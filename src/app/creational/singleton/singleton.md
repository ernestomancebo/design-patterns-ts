# Singleton Pattern

### Solves the need of:
  * Needing one instance of an object.
  * Guarantees that there's only one object in the entire aplication.
  * One global access point.

### Downside:
  * The state of the singleton is shared between the object clients.

### Examples:
  * File System.
  * Window Manager.
